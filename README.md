## ðŸŒŸ Introduction

Presently, I'm working on my capstone project for BrainStationâ€”a user-friendly restaurant recommendation system. The main goal is to understand each user's unique preferences, leading to delightful dining experiences and increased customer loyalty. Leveraging user-based collaborative filtering, the system provides personalized restaurant suggestions, which, in turn, have the potential to draw in new patrons through targeted and customized recommendations.
