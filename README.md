# Tasty Trail - Capstone Project <img align="right" src="https://github.com/ebeui/Brainstation_Capstone/blob/a396883ab5678e627a58a291254fe95b53df29c5/TastyTrail_logo_small.svg">


## Overview
Welcome to my capstone project for BrainStation ‚Äî a user-friendly restaurant recommendation system. The primary goal of this project is to create a data-driven recommendation system that understands each user's preferences and provides personalized restaurant suggestions, leading to delightful dining experiences and increased customer loyalty. The system utilizes user-based collaborative filtering techniques to offer targeted and customized recommendations, which can potentially attract new patrons and benefit restaurant owners.

## üí≠ Why a Restaurant Recommendation System?
In today's fast-paced world, people often rely on online platforms to find places to eat. However, with an overwhelming number of restaurants and diverse individual preferences, finding the perfect dining spot can be challenging. A personalized restaurant recommendation system can revolutionize the way people discover new places to eat. By leveraging data science and machine learning techniques, we can analyze users' past restaurant preferences, ratings, and other relevant information to offer tailored suggestions, saving users time and effort while enhancing their dining experiences.

## üöÄ Key Phases of the Project
This capstone project follows a structured approach, comprising the following key phases:

1. **[Data Collection](https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset)**: The foundation of any data-driven project is access to high-quality data. For this project, we acquire the necessary data from the Yelp dataset available on Kaggle.

2. **[Data Cleaning](https://github.com/ebeui/Brainstation_Capstone/blob/41acee22d03e72edb6538fe47cc1cf9f70f58d70/notebooks/1_data_preprocessing.ipynb)**: Raw data often contains inconsistencies and missing values. In this phase, we clean and preprocess the data to ensure it is suitable for analysis and modeling.

3. **[Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)](https://github.com/ebeui/Brainstation_Capstone/blob/41acee22d03e72edb6538fe47cc1cf9f70f58d70/notebooks/2_EDA_and_visualizations.ipynb)**: Exploring the data is crucial to gain insights, understand patterns, and identify trends. Through visualizations and statistical analysis, we delve into the dataset to extract meaningful information.

4. **[Initial Modeling](https://github.com/ebeui/Brainstation_Capstone/blob/41acee22d03e72edb6538fe47cc1cf9f70f58d70/notebooks/3_modeling.ipynb)**: To establish a baseline, we create an initial version of the restaurant recommendation system. This model will serve as a starting point for further improvements.

5. **[Advanced Modeling](https://github.com/ebeui/Brainstation_Capstone/blob/41acee22d03e72edb6538fe47cc1cf9f70f58d70/notebooks/4_model_evaluation.ipynb)**: In this phase, we explore more sophisticated algorithms and techniques, such as collaborative filtering, matrix factorization, or deep learning, to enhance the system's accuracy and recommendations.

## üìë Resources
I have organized the following resources for easy access:

- **Data Source**: The original Yelp dataset can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset).

- **Data Documentation**: Documentation of the Yelp dataset can be found [here](https://www.yelp.com/dataset/documentation/main).

- **Standup Progress Presentation**: This is a [presentation](https://github.com/ebeui/Brainstation_Capstone/blob/51ab6321b259b60c1d700d8a83ef8d650ab376ca/DianeLu_Deliverable3_ProgressStandup.pdf) of the progress made during development.
